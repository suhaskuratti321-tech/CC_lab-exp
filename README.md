## Performance Analysis of Type-1 and Type-2 Hypervisors

**Proxmox VE (Type-1) vs VMware Workstation (Type-2)**

---

## 📖 About the Experiment

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for **Cloud Computing Laboratory – Experiment 01**. The experiment focuses on comparing the performance of **Type-1 Hypervisor (Proxmox VE)** and **Type-2 Hypervisor (VMware Workstation)** by creating identical Ubuntu virtual machines and executing CPU benchmarks using **Sysbench**.

The experiment demonstrates how virtualization platforms differ in terms of CPU performance, latency, and resource utilization while using the same hardware configuration.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To analyze and compare the CPU performance of **Proxmox VE** and **VMware Workstation** using the Sysbench benchmarking tool under identical virtual machine configurations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the working of Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisors.
* Create Ubuntu virtual machines on Proxmox VE and VMware Workstation.
* Configure both virtual machines with identical resources.
* Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
* Install and execute Sysbench CPU benchmark.
* Compare execution time, events per second, and latency.
* Document observations using GitHub.
